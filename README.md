This repo has a GeoJSON file with Bangalore Metro lines and stations. Both functional and proposed lines.

## Data
The lines and stations (operational) come from [The Metro Rail Guy](https://themetrorailguy.com/bangalore-metro-information-map-updates/).Stations for the proposed lines are manually identified, so they are approximate but would largely be accurate for visual representations.
